# Deadly Ground
This was created a few years ago while I was a novice programmer and is only for Android. It is a simple game related to the classic game snake. Instead, however, the user is able to burrow underground prior to running into himself/herself. As the user continues, the speed will continually become faster and thus more challenging. 

The graphics are not very good as I am a programmer and not a designer. Thus this is not intended to be a big hit game, merely one to pass the time when bored.
